#  My Personal Portfolio Website

## About This Project

This website is my personal online portfolio, which I built using **React** with **Vite**. It is my digital resume and an exhibit of my skills and projects. I have created it to provide visitors with a quick and easy idea of who I am, what I can do, and the work I've done.
