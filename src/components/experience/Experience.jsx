              As a recent graduate, I may not have formal work experience in a
              company, but I have gained valuable hands-on experience through
              personal projects, particularly in web development. I've worked on
              a variety of web applications, where I applied my skills in both
              front-end and back-end development. These projects have provided
              me with real-world problem-solving experience, and I am confident
              in my ability to contribute to a professional team.
